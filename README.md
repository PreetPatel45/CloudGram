## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- AWS account with sufficient service limits
- Node.js (for frontend development)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PreetPatel45/CloudGram.git
   cd CloudGram
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   
   The infrastructure is deployed using 4 CloudFormation templates in sequential order:
   
   ```bash
   # Deploy core infrastructure
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name cloudgram-core \
     --template-body file://CF_templates/upload_file_template.yaml \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   
   # Deploy API and compute resources
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name cloudgram-api \
     --template-body file://CF_templates/recommendations.yaml \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   
   # Deploy ML pipeline
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name cloudgram-ml \
     --template-body file://CF_templates/CF_templates/ML_Pipeline.yaml \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   
   # Deploy monitoring and analytics
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name cloudgram-monitoring \
     --template-body file://CF_templates/loggging_monitoring.yaml \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```

3. **Configure Frontend**
   
   After successful deployment, update the API endpoint in your frontend configuration:
   
   ```javascript
   // Update src/config/api.js
   const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-api-gateway-url.amazonaws.com/prod';
   ```
   
   Get your API Gateway URL from the CloudFormation stack outputs:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
     --stack-name cloudgram-api \
     --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`ApiGatewayUrl`].OutputValue' \
     --output text
   ```

4. **Deploy Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Environment Variables

The CloudFormation templates automatically configure most environment variables. For local development, create a `.env` file:

```env
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-api-gateway-url.amazonaws.com/prod
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=your-cognito-user-pool-id
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=your-cognito-client-id
```
